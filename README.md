ESPBoard is an open-source project that makes a simple UI for the ESP8266 WiFi Board.
### What is the ESP8266?
The ESP8266 is a small microprocessor-like board that has a WiFi Chip in it. Even though its a tiny board, the circuits around the chip can do a lot, even working as a low voltage Web Server! It also can be a standalone device!
### How to use ESPBoard
